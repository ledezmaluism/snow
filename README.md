## What is snow?

It's a toolbox for the of design of integrated nonlinear optical devices. The original motivation was the simulation of thin-film lithium niobate devices; but other materials and platforms can be included as well.

It includes:

- A material database with dispersion
- Tools for simulating waveguide modes
- Nonlinear pulse propagation
